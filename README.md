## Developer Setup

**This repository requires `Python 3.10` at minimum -- prefer the latest `3.10.X`.**

A local Kubernetes cluster requires

* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/)
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)


### Installation

Prefer using a virtual Python environment when installing. Tools such as
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) can be used to set up the environment
using a specific Python version. [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) can be
used to install the desired Python version if your choice of OS does not provide
it for you.

Example install
```bash
python -m virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.10 venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install platform and developer extra packages
pip install --editable '.[dev]'
```

### Testing

`pytest` is used to run test.
```bash
cd /to/observability
pytest # runs both unit and integration tests
```

### Invoke Testing
While tests can be run with ``pytest <OPTIONS>`` there is an invoke handler to run tests using common patterns. The
tests are run in parallel by default (which can help determine if there are any unexpected dependencies between tests)
so that running the tests locally takes less time.

**NOTE:** *Requires* ``pytest-xdist`` *package to be installed. This is specified as a* **dev** *dependency when you
perform initial environment setup. If you set up your local environment before the invoke commands were added, you
may need to install this package.*

#### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `invoke test.all`           | Run all tests                             |
| `invoke test.unit`          | Run all tests marked as unittests         |
| `invoke test.integration`   | Run all tests marked as integration tests |

#### Arguments

All of the ``invoke text.<CMD>`` commands have a few common arguments you may pass.

- ``--level=<VALUE> `` [str] (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) Set logging output level. DEFAULT: DEBUG
- ``--maxfail=<VALUE>`` [int] Maximum number of tests allowed to fail before aborting test run. DEFAULT: 10
- ``--processes=<VALUE>`` [int] Number of test processes to run in parallel. DEFAULT: 5

Example:

```shell
$ invoke test.all --processes=2 --level="INFO" --maxfail=50
```

## Running the App

After installing the [required tools](#developer-setup), run `invoke deploy.local` for an initial local installation of
the Observability backend. It creates a minikube node in a docker instance (i.e. in a separate logical machine) running the
required infrastructure along with the Observability services. Destroy the installation with `invoke deploy.nuke`.

[More `invoke` info](#additional-tools).

### Useful commands
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `minikube ssh`                               | SSH into minikube machine                         |
| `minikube service list`                      | List all services and the endpoints to reach them |
| `minikube image build <docker build params>` | Build docker image inside minikube machine        |
| `minikube image load <image>`                | Push docker image from host to minikube machine   |


## Developer Experience

### Pre-commit + Linting

We enforce the use of certain linting tools. To not get caught by the build-system's checks, you should use
`pre-commit` to scan your commits before they go upstream.

The following hooks are enabled in pre-commit:

- `black`: The black formatter is enforced on the project. We use a basic configuration. Ideally this should solve any and all
formatting questions we might encounter.
- `isort`: the isort import-sorter is enforced on the project. We use it with the `black` profile.

To enable pre-commit from within your virtual environment, simply run:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Additional tools

These tools should be used by the developer because the build-system will enforce that the code complies with them.
These tools are pinned in the `dev` extra-requirements of `pyproject.toml`, so you can acquire them with

```sh
# within environment
pip install .[dev]
```

We use the following additional tools:

- `pytest`: This tool is used to run the test e.g. `pytest .`
- `mypy`: This is a static and dynamic type-checking tool. This also checks for unreachable and non-returning code. See `pyproject.toml` for its settings. This
tool is not included in pre-commit because doing so would require installing this repo's package and additional stubs into the pre-commit environment, which
is inadvised by pre-commit, and poorly supported.
- `invoke` (shorthand `inv`): This is a `make` replacement.
  - Run `invoke --list` to see available commands and e.g. `invoke deploy.restart --help` for additional info on command `restart`.
  - [Shell tab completion](https://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/invoke.html#shell-tab-completion)


### FAQ: mypy errors

#### I've encountered 'Unused "type: ignore" comment'

Good news, this means that `mypy` has found symbols for the thing which you are ignoring. That means its time to enable
type-checking on these code-paths.

To resolve this error, do two things:

1. Remove the ignore and fix any type errors.
2. run `mypy . --install-types` and add any newly installed `types-*` packages installed to our `dev` dependencies.
